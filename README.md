## üè∑Ô∏è **About the project**
> Your very first own library

This project is about coding a library with highly useful standard C functions.

## üì• **What I learned**
With this project, I discovered a lot of <ins>standard functions</ins> used in C. I also discovered what a **struct** and **lists** are.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Requirements**
The function must be written in C. It must compile with clang and the following flags :
- [x] -Wall
- [x] -Wextra
- [x] -Werror

‚õî *libtool command and global variables are forbidden.*

## üìç **Bonus**
What to do for the bonus part:
> Functions to manipulate memory and strings is very useful. But you will soon discover
that manipulating lists is even more useful.

The bonuses were a challenge at first because of the new notion of lists but once I looked up some tutorials online it was quite easy.

## üß† **New notions**
If you have trouble understanding the subject fully check the **man** for the functions. And if you have trouble with the new notions like `lists` or `struct` I highly recommand these:

## ‚ôªÔ∏è **Testing**
I strongly recommand you do your own main function to test your program.

If you want to make sure your program works, you can use third party testers like:
